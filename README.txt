GBA GAME - World’s Hardest Game Remake
~ Tilak Patel

This is the world’s hardest game. Get from the green starting point to the purple end point in order to win. Avoid the black enemies. Move the red character using the arrow keys (up, down, left, right). It has only one level that is really arduous. Run it using a GBA emulator. 

Good luck beating it!
